task is to write a simple web service which can parse Cloudtrail logs and give recommendations for better following the least privilege principle on AWS. You should use sanitized Cloudtrail logs (attached).

Required output:

    A simple webservice (without UI) parsing a CloudTrail gzipped file (uploaded in POST body)

    Listing all IAM users found in the log

    For each user showing the AWS permissions that were actually used based on the CloudTrail logs and recommend an IAM policy which would grant permission only to these “needed permissions”
